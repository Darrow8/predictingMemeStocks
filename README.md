# Predicting Meme Stocks
Trying to predict meme stocks' price on the basis of social media.

## Inspiration For the Project
Since the major rise in attention to r/wallstreetbets over the $GME controversy, I wondered if it would be possible to predict the price of meme stocks using what redditors and other social media sites were posting. 

## GME 
$GME is on the rise again, fueled by reddit with the same intentions. There has also been an r/GME subreddit that has picked up subscribers very quickly. I am currently writing a script to analyze $GME in concjunction with statistics from r/GME and r/wallstreetbets.
